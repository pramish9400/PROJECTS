I asked him: O my good slave, tell me where thou took that apple, that I may get the like of it? He laughed and answered: I got it from my mistress. For I had been absent and on my return I found her lying ill with three apples by her side, and she said to me: My horned wittol of a husband made a journey for them to Bassorah and bought them for three dinars. So I ate and drank with her and took this one from her. When I heard such words from the slave, O Commander of the Faithful, the world grew black before my face. Immediately I arose and locked up my shop and went home beside myself for excess of rage.

Then I hewed off her head and her limbs and wrapping her in her mantilla and a rag of carpet, hurriedly sewed up the whole, which I set in a chest. Locking it tight, I loaded it on my he-mule and threw it into the Tigris with my own hands. So Allah upon thee, O Commander of the Faithful, make hast to hang me, as I fear lest she appeal for vengeance on Resurrection Day.\n",

And he answered: I took one of the three apples which were by my mammy and went down into the lane to play with my brothers when behold, a big long black slave snatched it from my hand and said: Whence has thou this? I said: My father travelled far for it, and brought if from Bassorah for my mother who was ill and two other apples for which he paid three ducats. He took no heed of my words and I asked for the apple a second and a third time. But he cuffed me and kicked me and went off with it. I was afraid lest my mother should swinge me on account of the apple. So for fear of her I went with my brother outside the city and stayed there till evening closed in upon us.

I told him what had happened and he sat down by my side and wept and we ceased not weeping till midnight.

I asked him: O my good slave, tell me where thou took that apple, that I may get the like of it? He laughed and answered: I got it from my mistress. For I had been absent and on my return I found her lying ill with three apples by her side, and she said to me: My horned wittol of a husband made a journey for them to Bassorah and bought them for three dinars. So I ate and drank with her and took this one from her. When I heard such words from the slave, O Commander of the Faithful, the world grew black before my face. Immediately I arose and locked up my shop and went home beside myself for excess of rage. I looked for the apples and finding only two of the three asked my wife: O my cousin, where is the third apple? Raising her head languidly she answered: I don't know, O son of my uncle, where 'tis gone!\n",

Then I hewed off her head and her limbs and wrapping her in her mantilla and a rag of carpet, hurriedly sewed up the whole, which I set in a chest. Locking it tight, I loaded it on my he-mule and threw it into the Tigris with my own hands. So Allah upon thee, O Commander of the Faithful, make hast to hang me, as I fear lest she appeal for vengeance on Resurrection Day.\n",

Yet he knew nothing of what I had done with his mother. I asked him: What has made thee weep, my boy? And he answered: I took one of the three apples which were by my mammy and went down into the lane to play with my brothers when behold, a big long black slave snatched it from my hand and said: Whence has thou this? I said: My father travelled far for it, and brought if from Bassorah for my mother who was ill and two other apples for which he paid three ducats. He took no heed of my words and I asked for the apple a second and a third time. But he cuffed me and kicked me and went off with it. I was afraid lest my mother should swinge me on account of the apple. So for fear of her I went with my brother outside the city and stayed there till evening closed in upon us. By Allah, O my father, say nothing to her of this or it may add to her ailment!\n",

I told him what had happened and he sat down by my side and wept and we ceased not weeping till midnight.
