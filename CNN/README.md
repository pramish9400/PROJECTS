# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or convnet)
 
A convolutional neural network (CNN or convnet) is a subset of machine learning. It is one of the various types of artificial neural networks which are used for different applications and data types. A CNN is a kind of network architecture for deep learning algorithms and is specifically used for image recognition and tasks that involve the processing of pixel data.

There are other types of neural networks in deep learning, but for identifying and recognizing objects, CNNs are the network architecture of choice. This makes them highly suitable for computer vision (CV) tasks and for applications where object recognition is vital, such as self-driving cars and facial recognition.
